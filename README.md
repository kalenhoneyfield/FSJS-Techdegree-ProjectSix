# Portfolio.kalen
> A small express app to showcase the portfolio of work I have completed at Treehouse.


Portfolio.kalen is an express app that showcases projects I have completed at Treehouse. These projects range from a simple quote generator to this very app. My hope is that after reviewing these projects you will be able to see some of the technical and problem solving skill I have developed.
